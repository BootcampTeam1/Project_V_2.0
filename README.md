# Budgeter
Budgeter is a highly customizable budget app that allows users to plan and manage their expenses more efficiently. One is able to prioritize expenses by categories, monitor and track their monthly expenses, and create easy to read monthly expense reports.

Future implementation includes using React to create a one-page application, allowing users to create their own expense categories, cooperating with bank APIs and discount website APIs (Groupon), and installing a calendar to better narrow down dates. 

## Demo
